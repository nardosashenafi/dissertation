It is possible to manually switch between multi-modal controllers by using some
event trigger that implies mode changes in the dynamics. But this technique
poses two main difficulties. First, a system with $k$ contact events can have up
to $2^k$ contact combinations. It is quite difficult to parameterize the effects
of these contact combinations and find individual controllers for each mode.
Second, it is difficult to parameterize the relationship between the states and
the conditional that triggers the control switch.

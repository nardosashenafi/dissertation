\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:moe_conclusion}

In this chapter, we provide a data-driven control design that reasons about the
effects of contact forces on the hybrid system.
%
We incorporate accurate system model in the training via linear complementarity
formulation, and infer mixture of expert controllers.
%
The learning framework also provides a gating network, which selects an expert
for every observed state.
%
From simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the MoE
framework successfully provides a switching controller for multi-modal systems
and the learned policy leverages the advantages of contact in some states and
minimizes its adverse effects in others.
%
% Moreover, the gating network is able to characterize the states prone to
% contact, and selects the expert trained to react to the outcomes of potential
% contacts.

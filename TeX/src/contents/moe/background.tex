\section{Background}

In this section, we provide a brief introduction to contact modeling with the
linear complementarity formulation.
%
We also present a summary of the mixture of experts architecture and
its uses in machine learning.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:moe_methods}, we utilize the high-fidelity models obtained
from the linear complementarity formulation in order to design contact-aware
mixture of expert controllers through data-driven techniques.

\subsection{Contact Modeling with Linear Complementarity Problem}

Suppose a hybrid dynamical system consists of $k$ potential contacts, each
introducing normal contact forces $\lambda_N \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$ and Coulomb
friction forces $\lambda_T \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$ to the overall system.
%
The contact forces in this hybrid system enforce the geometric and kinematic
constraints of surfaces in contact.
%
For instance, the contact force between two objects in collision characterizes
the no-penetration conditions and the post-impact velocities of the objects.
%
An accurate contact model identifies the contact forces necessary to obey these
kinematic constraints, however resolving the contact forces accurately can be
difficult and computationally expensive.
%
Most collision simulators work on the kinematic level as opposed to the dynamic
level.
%
For instance, there are event detection methods~\cite{cellier1986combined} that
simply change the velocity of the moving objects at the time of impact.
%
One of the drawbacks of these techniques is finding the exact time the contact
occurs in high speed collision.
%
There is the additional difficulty of identifying the Coulomb friction.
% , which is
% especially prone to Painlev{{\'e}} Paradox~\cite{genot1999new} in high friction
% scenarios.
%
The linear complementarity formulation in~\cite{glocker2005formulation} provides
a rigorous technique to resolve contact forces, Coulomb friction and impact
forces in a hybrid system.
%
This formulation presents an optimization problem that searches for \it{contact force
and post-impact velocity} \normalfont pairs that obey the geometric and
kinematic constraints during contacts or impacts.
%

%
The linear complementarity formulation is constructed from kinematic and dynamic
constraints of contact, which we discuss as follows.
%
We begin by introducing the variables necessary to define the kinematic
constraints of a contact-rich system.
%
Suppose we have a contact-rich mechanism whose states $x \in \mathcal{X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^{2m}$ consists of generalized positions $q \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and
velocities $\dot{q}$.
%
Let $g_N(q) \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$ denote a vector of gap functions that measure
the normal distance between the contact surfaces. 
%
The normal and tangential relative velocities between the contact surfaces are
given by $\gamma_N = \dot{g}_N(q)$ and $\gamma_T$, respectively.
%
We can express the relative velocities $\gamma_N$ and $\gamma_T$ in terms of the
generalized velocities as 
%
\begin{align*}
  \gamma_N = W_N \dot{q}, \; \gamma_T = W_T \dot{q},
\end{align*}  
\noindent where $W_N$ and $W_T$ are the linear mappings from the generalized
coordinates to the local contact coordinates.
%
The kinematic constraints of contact provide a connection between pre- and
post-impact velocities throughout this formulation, thus we introduce the
following notations.
%
The pre- and post-impact generalized velocities are denoted by $\dot{q}^-$ and
$\dot{q}^+$, respectively, and their corresponding relative velocities are given
by
\begin{align*}
  \gamma_N^+ = W_N\dot{q}^+, \; \gamma_T^+ = W_T\dot{q}^-, \\
  \gamma_N^- = W_N\dot{q}^-, \; \gamma_T^- = W_T\dot{q}^-.
\end{align*}
%
The kinematic constraint of contact states that two rigid bodies undergoing
contact must always maintain a normal distance such that $g_N \geq 0$. Moreover,
in the presence of contacts, the post-impact velocities can be found from the
pre-impact velocities as:
\begin{align}
  \begin{gathered}
    \gamma_N^+ = -\epsilon_N \gamma_N^-, \\
    \gamma_T^+ = -\epsilon_T \gamma_T^-,
  \end{gathered}
  \label{eq:postimpactVel}
\end{align}
\noindent where $\epsilon_N \in \mathbb{R}^k$ and $\epsilon_T \in \mathbb{R}^k$
are diagonal matrices consisting of the normal and tangential coefficients of
restitution, respectively.

%
The dynamic constraints of contact-rich system are given by the
model~\cite{glocker2005formulation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    M(q) \dd \dot{q} + h(q, \dot{q})\dd t - \dd R  = 0, \\
    h(q, \dot{q}) = C(q, \dot{q})\dot{q} + G(q) - Bu(q, \dot{q}), \\
    \dd R = W_N \dot{\lambda}_N \dd t + W_T \dot{\lambda}_T \dd t
  \end{gathered}
  \label{eq:hybrid_dynamics}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ denotes the positive-definite
mass matrix, $C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ holds the Coriolis and centripetal
terms, and $G \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the gravitational term. The matrix $B \in
\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ maps the input $u \in \mathcal{U} \subset
\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to the generalized coordinates and $\dd R$ captures the effects
of contact forces and Coulomb friction exerted on the system.  The dynamic
constraint in~\eqref{eq:hybrid_dynamics} characterizes how the local contact
forces affect the dynamics of the overall system.
\begin{rem}
  Unlike the classical second order equations of motion $M(q) \ddot{q} + h(q,
  \dot{q}) = 0$, the measure differential inclusion
  in~\eqref{eq:hybrid_dynamics} can characterize the behavior of the system
  under impact forces. Notice that in the presence of impacts, the velocity
  $\dot{q}$ is not continuous for all time, thus the acceleration $\ddot{q}$
  does not exist everywhere. For further understanding of how the measure
  equality can accurately represent the impact dynamics, we refer the reader
  to~\cite{moreau1988unilateral}.
\end{rem}

We first motivate the linear complementarity formulation for normal contact
forces, where the system has no Coulomb friction.
% 
The linear complementarity formulation imposes a unilateral constraint between
contact forces and relative velocities given by:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    0 \leq 
      \xi_N(q, \dot{q}) 
      \perp
      \lambda_N  
      \geq 0, \\
  % \end{eqnarray}
  % \begin{eqnarray}
      \xi_N(q, \dot{q}) := \gamma_N^+ + \epsilon_N \gamma_N^-.
  \end{gathered}
  \label{eq:complementarity} 
\end{equation}
\noindent where $0 \leq a \perp b \geq 0$ denotes $a \geq 0, b \geq 0$ and
$a^\top b=0$.
% 
The physical interpretation of~\eqref{eq:complementarity} can be given as
follows.
%
% We first look at the properties of normal contact forces and relative velocities
% during contacts, and we translate the same concept to the tangential direction.
%
In the presence of contacts and impacts, the post-impact velocities can be found
from pre-impact velocities by~\eqref{eq:postimpactVel}.
%
In this scenario, the quantity $\xi_N$ evaluates to zero, because
\begin{align*}
  \xi_N &= -\epsilon_N \gamma_N^- + \epsilon_N \gamma_N^- = 0.
\end{align*}
%
The complementarity constraint in~\eqref{eq:complementarity} states that when
two surfaces come into contact, the resultant between pre- and post-impact
velocities, given by $\xi_N$ must be zero, and in the meantime, the contact
forces can take positive values.
%
Conversely, if there are no potential contacts, the relative velocities are
continuous, i.e. $\gamma_N^+ = \gamma_N^- = \gamma_N$.
%
In this case, the complementarity constraint states that $\xi_N$ can be
non-zero, which is analogues to contact surfaces approaching each other or
moving away from each other, but the normal contact forces $\lambda_N$ must be
zero. 
%
There exists no scenario when both the contact force $\lambda_N$ and the
difference in pre- and post-impact velocities $\xi_N$ are both positive.
%
This concept is summarized as shown in Table~\ref{tab:complementarity}.

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

    Scenario & $g_N$ & $\gamma_N^-$ & $\gamma_N^+$ & $\xi_N$ & $\lambda_N$ \\

  \caption{Construction of complementarity condition for Coulomb friction}
  \label{fig:tangential_to_complementarity}
\end{figure}

With this understanding in mind, we extend the complementarity condition
in~\eqref{eq:complementarity} to a system with normal and tangential contact
forces.
%
Unfortunately, the complementarity constraints given in
Table~\ref{tab:complementarity} do not directly translate to tangential contact
forces $\lambda_T$ and relative velocities $\xi_T$.
%
% For instance, unlike the normal contact force $\lambda_N$, the tangential
% force (Coulomb friction) $\lambda_T$ is not constrained to non-negative
% values.
%
To best explain the reason, consider the contact forces applied on a box sliding
on a flat surface with Coulomb friction.
%
The properties of the contact forces exerted on the sliding box are depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:unilateral_primitive}.
%
On the left, we show the graphical representation of the complementarity
constraint between $\lambda_N$ and $\xi_N$.
%
On the right, we have the relationship between Coulomb forces $\lambda_T$ and
$\xi_T$.
%
The right figure shows that if the box is sliding to the right ($\xi_T > 0$),
the tangential force acts to the left, resisting the motion of the box.
%
If the box moves to the left, the tangential forces apply resistive force to
the right.
%
The maximum $\lambda_T$ applied on the system is $\mu \lambda_N$, where $\mu$ is
the coefficient of friction.
%
Notice, the relationship between $\lambda_T$ and $\xi_T$ is not complementary.
%
However, the plot of $\lambda_T$ can be split into two components $\lambda_R$
and $\lambda_L$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tangential_to_complementarity},
which individually resemble the complementarity properties of $\lambda_N$ and
$\xi_T$ in Figure~\ref{fig:unilateral_primitive}.
%
The new quantities $\lambda_R$ and $\lambda_L$ are defined as~\cite{glocker2005formulation}
\begin{align*}
  \lambda_R := \mu \lambda_N + \lambda_T, \\
  \lambda_L := \mu \lambda_N - \lambda_T, 
\end{align*}
\noindent and the corresponding complementarity condition becomes
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{gathered}
    0 \leq 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \xi_R(q, \dot{q}) \\
      \xi_L(q, \dot{q})
    \end{pmatrix} 
    \perp
      \begin{pmatrix}
        \lambda_R  \\
        \lambda_L
      \end{pmatrix} \geq 0,
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}
where $\xi_T = \xi_R - \xi_L$.
%
These definitions help us express the resultant pre- and post-impact
velocities $\xi_N, \xi_R, \xi_L$ as the following affine function: 
\begin{align*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \xi_N \\
    \xi_R \\
    \lambda_L
  \end{pmatrix} =
      A
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \lambda_N \\
      \lambda_R \\
      \xi_L
    \end{pmatrix} + b, 
\end{align*}
\noindent where the values of $A$ and $b$ are extracted from the dynamics. We
refer the reader to~\cite{glocker2005formulation} for detailed derivation of the
forms of $A$ and $b$, and present the results as
\begin{gather*}
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
      W_N M^{-1} (W_N - W_T \mu) & W_N M^{-1} W_N & 0  \\
      W_T M^{-1} (W_N - W_T \mu) & W_T M^{-1} W_T & I_k  \\
      2\mu & -I_k & 0
    \end{bmatrix}, \;  b = \begin{bmatrix}
      W_N M^{-1} h \Delta t + (I_k+\epsilon_N) \gamma_N\\
      W_T M^{-1} h \Delta t + (I_k+\epsilon_T) \gamma_T\\
      0
    \end{bmatrix}, 
\end{gather*}
\noindent where $I_k$ is the $k \times k$
identity matrix, and $\Delta t$ is the integration time step.
%
The linear complementarity problem (LCP)~\eqref{eq:complementarity} can be posed as
the following feasibility problem:

\begin{equation}
    0 \leq 
    \left[ A \begin{pmatrix}
      \lambda_N \\
      \lambda_R \\
      \xi_L
    \end{pmatrix} + b \right]
    \perp
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \lambda_N \\
      \lambda_R \\
      \xi_L
    \end{pmatrix} \geq 0, \\
  \label{eq:feasibility} 
\end{equation}
\noindent which we can solve for $\lambda_N, \lambda_R, \xi_L$ with various
optimization techniques. 

We follow Moreau's time stepping algorithm~\cite{glocker2005formulation}
outlined in Algorithm~\eqref{algo:moreau} to numerically integrate the
dynamics~\eqref{eq:hybrid_dynamics}. 
%
In this procedure, we first use the kinematics of the system to evaluate the
position vector $q$ after a half-time step as
\begin{align*}
  q(t+\nicefrac{\Delta t}{2}) = q(t) +  (\nicefrac{\Delta t}{2}) \dot{q}(t) 
\end{align*}
%
This allows us to check the gap functions for possible penetration between
contact surfaces at time $t+\nicefrac{\Delta t}{2}$.
%
If all the gap functions are positive, we determine that there are no
contact forces applied.
%
On the other hand, if any of the gap functions are non-positive, we compose a
complementarity constraint for the active contacts as given
in~\eqref{eq:feasibility}.
%
While the complementarity constraint can be posed as a feasibility problem, the
presence of Coulomb friction makes it a non-convex optimization problem. 
%
We use a pivoting (basis-exchange) technique called Lemke's
algorithm~\cite{acary2008numerical} to find the solution to the linear
complementarity problem~\eqref{eq:feasibility}. The fact that Lemke's algorithm
may be automatically differentiated to provide the gradients of the pertinent
variables allows us to seamlessly integrate the solution to the differential
equations into machine learning algorithms.
%
We substitute the contact forces $\lambda_N, \lambda_T$ provided by Lemke's
algorithm into the equations of motion~\eqref{eq:hybrid_dynamics} to compute the
post-impact velocities as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \dot{q}(t+\Delta t) = M^{-1}(W_T \lambda_T + W_N \lambda_N + h\Delta t) + \dot{q}(t)
\end{align*}
%
This procedure is repeated for time horizon $T$.

\subsection{Mixture of Expert Models}
\label{ssec:mixture_of_experts}

The mixture of experts (MOE) architecture is primarily used to learn an ensemble
of expert models that best fit high variance or multi-modal datasets.
%
Suppose we are trying to model the source of the dataset shown on the left of
Figure~\ref{fig:gaussian_moe}.
%
A single Gaussian distribution provides a poor fit to the multi-modal data.
%
MOE framework allows us to fit multiple uni-modal distributions as shown on
the right of Figure~\ref{fig:gaussian_moe}.
%
This technique uses a gating network to divide the input space $x \in
\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^{2m}$ into state partitions within which a single
expert is active.
%
The objective is to learn the expert models and the gating network that
best fit the dataset.
%

The expert models and the gating networks can take several forms. 
%
Gaussian process experts and gating networks are commonly used in the MOE
framework to find a multi-modal probabilistic model from a small amount of
data~\cite{bishop2006pattern}.
%
However, as the observations from the dataset grow large, the Gaussian process
experts impose large computational and memory
overhead~\cite{harkonen2022mixtures}.
%
Moreover, Gaussian gating networks can only provide a quadratic parameterization
of the boundaries of the state partitions.
%
Hence, we leverage the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks
for both the experts and the gating network.
%
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gaussian_moe.png}
  \caption{Left: Fit with one Gaussian distribution. Right: Fit with Gaussian
  mixture of 2 experts~\cite{mcgonagle_dobre_pilling}}
  \label{fig:gaussian_moe}
\end{figure}

Let $F(x)$ denote a collection of $N_F$ expert models $F(x) = \{F_1(x),
\dots, F_{N_{F}}(x)\}$, whose parameters are given by the set
$\theta=\{\theta_1, \dots, \theta_{N_{F}} \}$.
%
% Henceforth, we assume that the number of state partitions is the same as the
% number of available expert controller.
%
The gating network $\mathbf{P}(x| \psi) := (P_1(x| \psi), \\ \dots, P_{N_F}(x|
\psi))$ is a collection of probabilities, where $P_i(x | \psi)$ denotes the
probability of state $x$ belonging to state partition $i \in \{1, \dots, N_F \}$. 
%
We parameterize the gating network with a neural network $\mathbf{P}(x| \psi) :
\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N_F}$ with parameters $\psi$, and the output
corresponds to the vector $[P_1(x| \psi), \dots, P_{N_F}(x| \psi)]$.
%
We use a \textsc{Softmax} activation function on the last layer to ensure that the
probabilities $P_i(x | \psi)$ over all state partitions $i$ sum to one.
%
The objective is to learn the decision parameters $(\psi, \theta)$ from observed
data.

We use a categorical probability distribution to sample a state partition based
on the outputs of the gating network as follows~\cite{harkonen2022mixtures} 
\begin{align}
  i | x, \psi \sim \text{Categorical}(\mathbf{P}(x| \psi)). 
  \label{eq:gating_categorical}
\end{align}
%
% The prediction from the mixture of experts $F(x; \theta)$ is given by the linear
% combination over the \it{responsibility} \normalfont of each state partition.
%
% \begin{align*}
%   F(x; \theta) &= \sum_{i=1}^{N_F}F_i(x; \theta_i)P_i(x | \psi).
% \end{align*}
A single expert is active in each state partition hence the prediction $u(x;
\theta)$ at input state $x$ is given by 
\begin{align*}
  a &= \underset{i}{\textrm{argmax}} \{ P_i(x | \psi) \},\\
  u(x; \theta) &= F_a(x; \theta_a).
\end{align*}


There are several techniques to learn the parameters of the
expert models and the gating network. A common approach is \it{expectation
maximization} \normalfont (EM).
%
In this technique, we first compose the expectation over the log likelihood
as~\cite{bishop2006pattern}   
\begin{align}
  \ln \{P(\mathbb{D} | \theta, \psi)\} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \ln \sum_{i=1}^{N_F} \mathcal{N}( \norm{F_i(x_j; \theta_i) - y_j}{} \; | \; 0,s) P_i(x_j, \psi) ,
  \label{eq:original_normal_likelihood}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard
deviation $s$. The dataset $\mathbb{D} = \{(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_N, y_N)\}$ is a
collection of $N$ training observations, and $\norm{F_i(x_j; \theta_i) - y_j}{}$
is the error in the prediction made by the expert $i$. 
% 
Notice that the likelihood measures how likely the current parameters $(\psi,
\theta)$ are to generate the sampled data $\mathbb{D}$. 
%
The goal is to maximize the likelihood and consequently minimize prediction
error.
%
The likelihood~\eqref{eq:original_normal_likelihood} is maximum when the
parameter $\theta_i$ has the lowest prediction error and the highest probability
of getting selected by the gating network.
%
The standard EM approach evaluates~\eqref{eq:original_normal_likelihood} and uses
gradient-based techniques to iteratively update the parameters $(\psi, \theta)$.
%
To do so, we can expand the likelihood as 
\begin{align*}
  \ln \{P(\mathbb{D} | \theta, \psi) \} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \ln \sum_{i=1}^{N_F} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi s^2}} \exp \Biggl( -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\norm{F_i(x_j; \theta_i) - y_j}{}^2}{s^2} \Biggr) P_i(x_j, \psi),
\end{align*}
\noindent and extract the relevant parts of the likelihood in order to
define a simplified form given by
\begin{equation}
  \ln \{P(\mathbb{D} | \theta, \psi) \} \propto \mathbb{L}(\mathbb{D} | \theta, \psi) :=  \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N_F} -\norm{F_i(x_j; \theta_i) - y_j}{}^2 P_i(x_j | \psi). 
  \label{eq:log_normal_likelihood}
\end{equation}
%
Depending on the complexity of the experts and the gating network, we can take
analytical gradients of $\mathbb{L}$ with respect to the decision parameters
($\psi, \theta$) or leverage auto-differentiation
techniques~\cite{revels2016forward}. 
%
The EM framework uses stochastic-gradient descent to iteratively update the
decision parameters.

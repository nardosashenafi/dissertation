In this work, we provide several data-driven control design frameworks for
contact-rich robotic systems.
%
These systems exhibit continuous and discrete state transitions, which makes
them difficult to control with one optimal policy.
%
Hence, we design a control learning mechanism that provides a mixture of expert
controllers parameterized by neural networks. 
%
This architecture also learns a gating network, which determines the control
switching scheme based on the observed states.
%
Additionally, we address the adverse effects of model uncertainties in the
control of contact-rich robots.
%
Lack of accurate environmental models can misrepresent the effects of contact
forces on the system.
%
Optimal policies designed from such models can lead to poor performance or even
instability.
%
In particular, we demonstrate the effects of system parameter uncertainties and 
measurement error on the overall performance of the system.
%
Then, we leverage the stability properties of passivity-based control in
conjunction with the robustness properties of Bayesian learning to infer
stochastic controllers.

We provide several data-driven control design frameworks for contact-rich
robotic systems.
%
These systems exhibit continuous~\todo{conts transitions don't exist.} and discrete state transitions, which makes
them difficult to control with one optimal~\todo{doesn't have to be optimal}
policy.~\todo{because... mention why briefly.}
%
Hence, we design a control learning mechanism that provides a mixture of expert
controllers parameterized by neural networks.~\todo{neural nets are the
parametrizations, not the parameters.} 
%
This architecture also learns a gating network, which determines the region of
validity of each expert, based on the observed states.
%
Additionally, we address the adverse effects of model uncertainties in the
control of contact-rich robots.
%
Lack of accurate environmental models can misrepresent the effects of contact
forces on the system.
%
Optimal policies designed from such models can lead to poor performance or even
instability.
%
In particular, we demonstrate the effects of system parameter uncertainties and 
measurement errors on the overall performance of the system.
%
Then, we leverage the stability properties of passivity-based control in
conjunction with the robustness properties of Bayesian learning to
infer~\todo[inline]{these are not leveraged to ``learn'' the controllers, they are the
properties of the learned controllers}
stochastic controllers.

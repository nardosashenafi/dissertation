\chapter{Introduction}

This is an attempt at a template for your thesis using the latest
versions and features of \LaTeX (version $2\epsilon$).  

Even if you are unfamiliar with \LaTeX, you should be able to pick it
up with little effort. The nice thing is that \LaTeX does all
type-setting for you, and you don't need to worry about where to
insert figures, order references etc. etc. Your systems administrator
should be able to help you install the necessary software, and the
rest of particular files you need to create your thesis are packed
with this template.

\LaTeX is free, and runs under most operating systems (MAC, Windows,
Unix or Linux).

This template is very close to the demands for style in the
``Standards'' brochure of BSU, and based on the ``report'' class in
\LaTeX. Special tweaks of certain things (like the generation of the
committee sheet, and the layout of the title page) are done in a file
called BSUthesis.sty. {\bf DO NOT ALTER THIS FILE}.  Instead shoot me
an e-mail or drop by if something needs changing.

Deterministic data-driven techniques
-Have many uses in 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Soft robotics: used for nonlinear modelling, calibration, positioning
    control of soft actuators, grasping, motion planning.
\end{itemize}
-Some techniques are 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supervised -> Imitation learning \cite{reignier1997incremental}
    \item Reinforcement learning
    \item Passivity-based control with unsupervised learning
    \item 
\end{itemize}

In this work, we explore the capabilities of data-driven techniques for the
control of underactuated mechanical systems. Frameworks, such as data-driven
passivity-based control~\cite{neuralpbc} are capable of learning viable policies
while providing insight on the overall stability of the closed-loop system.
Nevertheless, inaccuracies in the system models can deteriorate the performance
of the learned controllers. To address this issue, we design a Bayesian policy
learning framework that accounts for system parameter uncertainties and
measurement error. We demonstrate the robustness properties of the Bayesian
framework through simple examples and a series of simulation and real-world
experiments undertaken on the simple pendulum and the inertia wheel pendulum.
Finally, we propose a research plan to extend the Bayesian technique to design
controllers for contact-rich systems.

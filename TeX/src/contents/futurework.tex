We tackle two main difficulties in the control of contact-rich robotic systems.
%
First, we address the computational complexities in designing multi-modal
controllers for hybrid dynamical systems.
%
In our framework, we use data-driven techniques to infer a mixture of expert
controller that switches between several policies.
%
The learning architecture also provides a gating network, which governs the
control switching scheme based on the observed states.
%
We use the linear complementarity formulation to accurately model
contact-rich systems and to train contact-aware MOE controller in simulaion.
%
This data-driven technique finds controllers that react to the positive or negative
effects of contacts and impacts.
%
We demonstrate this behavior on the swing-up problem of the cartpole system.
%
We modify the standard cartpole problem to a multi-modal contact-rich mechanism
by introducing wall barriers on each sides of the system.
%
Using the MOE architecture, we successfully swing up the cartpole in simulation
and hardware.
%
The case study shows that the contact-aware controller finds a way to leverage the impact
from the wall barriers to catch the pendulum post-impact.
%

Secondly, we characterize and tackle the effects of model uncertainties in the
control of dynamical system.

In particular,

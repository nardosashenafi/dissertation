\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:bl_conclusion}

This work presents a data-driven passivity based control architecture that encodes
the desired Hamiltonian of the system with a neural network. 
%
The learning approach efficiently explores the state space using the state
sampling technique and enforces a desired behavior through a carefully
designed loss function.
%
To improve the robustness properties of the controller, we parameterize the
desired Hamiltonian with a Bayesian neural network, whose weights are sampled
from a Gaussian posterior learned from MCMC and variational inference
techniques.
%
Through the simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework finds control laws that stabilize a desired equilibrium point of a
dynamical system. 
%
Moreover, the Bayesian framework can handle significant system
parameters uncertainties and measurement error.

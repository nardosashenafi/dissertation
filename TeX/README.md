# BSU_LaTeX_Thesis_Template

This is LaTeX2e template for the Boise State University Graduate Thesis.

You can find a Microsoft Word template [here](http://graduatecollege.boisestate.edu/thesisdissertation/files/2014/11/Boise_State_Thesis_and_Dissertation_Template.dotm); you can find standard formatting instructions [here](http://graduatecollege.boisestate.edu/thesisdissertation/files/2014/11/Boise_State_Thesis_and_Dissertation_Template.dotm).

BSU also has a thesis and dissertation page with helpful information [here](https://graduatecollege.boisestate.edu/thesisdissertation/template/).

If you are a Computer Science major, you can find the CS Master's thesis template from Amit Jain [here](http://cs.boisestate.edu/~amit/teaching/handouts/CS%20MS%20Thesis%20Style.html).

The template contained in this [GitHub](https://github.com) repository is a generic template meeting the most recent [Boise State University](http://www.boisestate.edu) thesis format requirements. If you have questions or run into problems with the format, please email bsulatex@cgiss.boisestate.edu or open an [issue](https://github.com/dylanmikesell/BSU_LaTeX_Thesis_Template/issues).

To run the example LaTeX and build a sample thesis, go to the src/ folder and run 

`$ make`

This will run _pdflatex_, compile your _bibtex_, and leave you with a pdf file (BSUmain.pdf). You can open this with any pdf viewer of your choice.

If you're looking for help on LaTeX I suggest starting [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) or type your question into a web search. There are tons of LaTeX introductions out there on the web as well as user forums where others have probably asked your question many times before.

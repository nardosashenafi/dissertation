# Nardos Ph.D. Proposal Rehearsal

### Targeted time: 40 minutes
### Time elapsed: 39 minutes 

#### USE MORE FIGURES!


* We may need a better explanation for what the deterministic solution vs.
  Bayesian solution is.


* What does "the deterministic solution is overconfident." mean?

* Algorithm: say: you can use uninformative priors

* Gradient of Elbo --> put labels over the lines to describe what the arrows are
  doing 


* IDA-PBC may require a reference witha footnote.

* Where do these PDEs come from? Needs better explanation, why are they even a
  thing? (Underactuation)



* On the right you have A, B, C; on the left you have 3 rings, 2 rings, 1
  ring...

* 34 minutes elapsed until "Future work"


* This picture of a rimless wheel has very poor resolution -- need a vector
  graphic.

* Why don't you give as reference Wankun's work on rimless wheel?

* Spend more time on the timeline.
